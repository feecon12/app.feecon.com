# Security Improvements Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security improvements implemented in the backend server of the application. These improvements follow industry best practices and standards to secure the API against common security threats.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. HTTP Security Headers

- **Helmet Integration**: Added Helmet middleware to set various HTTP security headers.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implemented CSP to prevent XSS attacks.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME sniffing vulnerabilities.
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks.
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Additional layer of protection against cross-site scripting.
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connection.
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls the information sent in the Referrer header.
- **Permissions-Policy**: Limits browser features that can be used on the website.

### 2. Rate Limiting

- **General Rate Limiter**: Protects all API endpoints from excessive requests.
- **Auth-specific Rate Limiter**: Stricter rate limits for authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Input Sanitization**: Implemented middleware to sanitize all incoming request data.
- **Parameter Pollution Prevention**: Prevents parameter pollution attacks by ensuring parameters aren't duplicated.

### 4. Security Monitoring

- **Suspicious Request Logging**: Logs potentially malicious requests that match attack patterns.
- **Auth Attempt Logging**: Logs successful and unsuccessful authentication attempts.
- **Security Threat Detection**: Detects and logs potential SQL injection and XSS attacks in request parameters.

### 5. Error Handling

- **Secure Error Responses**: Implemented error handling that prevents leaking sensitive information in error messages.
- **Custom 404 Handling**: Generic 404 response to avoid information disclosure.

### 6. CORS Configuration

- **Secure CORS Settings**: Configured CORS to only allow requests from trusted origins.
- **Method Restrictions**: Limited HTTP methods to only those needed.
- **Header Restrictions**: Limited allowed headers to only those needed.

### 7. Server Resilience and Monitoring

- **Dynamic Port Assignment**: Server automatically finds an available port if the preferred port is in use.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper handling of termination signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT) for clean server shutdown.
- **Health Check Endpoint**: Added `/health` endpoint to monitor server and database status.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Server tracks and reports memory usage and uptime.

## Usage and Best Practices

### Security Configuration

Security and server configurations are centralized in the following files:

- `utils/security.ts`: Contains security configuration functions and settings, including port availability detection.
- `utils/securityMiddleware.ts`: Contains security middleware functions.
- `utils/securityMonitoring.ts`: Contains security monitoring and logging functions.
- `utils/serverUtils.ts`: Contains server management utilities for health checks and graceful shutdown.

### Adding New Endpoints

When adding new endpoints, ensure:

1. Protected routes use the `protectRoute` middleware.
2. Sensitive operations have appropriate rate limiting.
3. Input validation and sanitization are applied.
4. Proper error handling is implemented.

### Keeping Security Updated

1. Regularly update dependencies to ensure security patches are applied.
2. Periodically review and update security settings based on new threats and best practices.
3. Consider implementing automated security testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement JWT token rotation and blacklisting for improved authentication security.
2. Add two-factor authentication for sensitive operations.
3. Set up automated security vulnerability scanning.
4. Implement API key management for third-party integrations.
5. Add logging to external monitoring service for better security incident detection.

# Auth Controller Security Improvements - Completed

Below are the security improvements that have been implemented in the authentication system:

## 1. Security Improvements Implemented

✅ **Stronger password requirements with validation**

- Password strength validation enforcing:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters

✅ **Improved JWT token management**

- Implemented access token (short-lived, 15 minutes) and refresh token (long-lived, 7 days)
- Added token expiration handling
- Automatic token refresh mechanism

✅ **Token blacklisting for logout**

- Added TokenBlacklist service to invalidate tokens on logout
- In-memory blacklist with expiry cleanup

✅ **Account security features**

- Account locking after 5 failed login attempts
- 30-minute lockout period
- Proper error messages without revealing specific information

✅ **Security audit logging**

- Added comprehensive logging for security events
- Tracking of login success/failure, account locking, registration, etc.
- IP address and user agent logging

✅ **Email verification for new accounts**

- Added email verification token generation
- Email verification flow

✅ **CSRF protection**

- Added CSRF token generation and validation

✅ **Improved OTP security**

- Replaced simple random number with cryptographically secure token generation

✅ **JWT payload security**

- Ensured JWT contains minimal information (only userId)

## 2. Structure Improvements Implemented

✅ **Utilities and services**

- Created auth security utilities (`authSecurity.ts`)
- Implemented token management service (`tokenManagement.ts`)
- Added security logging service (`authLogger.ts`)

✅ **TypeScript improvements**

- Added TypeScript interfaces for authentication types
- Improved type safety throughout the codebase

## Next Steps

The following items from the refactoring plan still need to be implemented:

- Complete CSRF protection integration
- Add password history to prevent reuse
- Complete email verification flow with frontend integration
- Implement proper request validation middleware
- Extract email sending to a dedicated service
- Add unit and integration tests for auth flows
